    The Agent SCML2020World Interface for SCML2020 world.

    This class contains all the methods needed to access the simulation to
    extract information which are divided into 5 groups:

    Static World Information:
        Information about the world and the agent that does not change over
        time. These include:

        A. Market Information:
          - *n_products*: Number of products in the production chain.
          - *n_processes*: Number of processes in the production chain.
          - *n_competitors*: Number of other factories on the same production level.
          - *all_suppliers*: A list of all suppliers by product.
          - *all_consumers*: A list of all consumers by product.
          - *catalog_prices*: A list of the catalog prices (by product).
          - *inputs*: Inputs to every manufacturing process.
          - *outputs*: Outputs to every manufacturing process.
          - *is_system*: Is the given system ID corresponding to a system agent?
          - *is_bankrupt*: Is the given agent bankrupt (None asks about self)?
          - *current_step*: Current simulation step (inherited from `negmas.situated.AgentWorldInterface` ).
          - *n_steps*: Number of simulation steps (inherited from `negmas.situated.AgentWorldInterface` ).

        B. Agent Information:
          - *profile*: Gives the agent profile including its production cost, number
            of production lines, input product index, mean of its delivery
            penalties, mean of its disposal costs, standard deviation of its
            shortfall penalties and standard deviation of its disposal costs.
            See `OneShotProfile` for full description. This information is private
            information and no other agent knows it.
          - *n_lines*: the number of production lines in the factory (private information).
          - *is_first_level*: Is the agent in the first production level (i.e. it is an
            input agent that buys the raw material).
          - *is_last_level*: Is the agent in the last production level (i.e. it is an
            output agent that sells the final product).
          - *is_middle_level*: Is the agent neither a first level nor a last level agent
          - *my_input_product*: The input product to the factory controlled by the agent.
          - *my_output_product*: The output product from the factory controlled by the agent.
          - *my_input_products*: All input products of a factory controlled by the agent.
            Currently, it is always a list of one item. For future compatibility.
          - *my_output_products*: All output products of a factory controlled by the agent.
            Currently, it is always a list of one item. For future compatibility.
          - *available_for_production*: Returns the line-step slots available for production.
          - *level*: The production level which is numerically the same as the input product.
          - *my_suppliers*: A list of IDs for all suppliers to the agent (i.e. agents
            that can sell the input product of the agent).
          - *my_consumers*: A list of IDs for all consumers to the agent (i.e. agents
            that can buy the output product of the agent).
          - *penalties_scale*: The scale at which to calculate disposal cost/delivery
            penalties. "trading" and "catalog" mean trading and
            catalog prices. "unit" means the contract's unit price
            while "none" means that disposal cost/shortfall penalty
            are absolute.
          - *n_input_negotiations*: Number of negotiations with suppliers.
          - *n_output_negotiations*: Number of negotiations with consumers.
          - *state*: The full state of the agent ( `FactoryState` ).
          - *current_balance*: The current balance of the agent
          - *current_inventory*: The current inventory of the agent (quantity per product)

    Dynamic World Information:
        Information about the world and the agent that changes over time.

        A. Market Information:
          - *trading_prices*: The trading prices of all products. This information
            is only available if `publish_trading_prices` is
            set in the world.
          - *exogenous_contract_summary*: A list of n_products tuples each giving
            the total quantity and average price of
            exogenous contracts for a product. This
            information is only available if
            `publish_exogenous_summary` is set in
            the world.

        B. Other Agents' Information:

            is at level zero, this will be empty.
          - *current_output_issues*: The current issues for all negotiations to buy
            the output product of the agent. If the agent

          - *spot_market_quantity*: The quantity the agent bought from the spot market at
                                    a given step

    Actions:
        A. Negotiation Control:
          - *request_negotiations*: Requests a set of negotiations controlled by a
            single controller.
          - *request_negotiation*: Requests a negotiation controlled by a single
            negotiator.

        B. Production Control:

      - *logdebug_agent/loginf_agnet/...*: Logs to the agent specific log at the given log level.
      - *bb_query*: Queries the bulletin-board.
      - *bb_read*: Read a section of the bulletin-board.
