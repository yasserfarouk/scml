class TradingStrategy:
    """Base class for all trading strategies.

    Provides:
        - `inputs_needed` (np.ndarray):  How many items of the input product do
          I need to buy at every time step (n_steps vector).
          This should be read **but not updated** by the `NegotiationManager`.
        - `outputs_needed` (np.ndarray):  How many items of the output product
          do I need to sell at every time step (n_steps vector).
          This should be read **but not updated** by the `NegotiationManager`.
        - `inputs_secured` (np.ndarray):  How many items of the input product I
          already contracted to buy (n_steps vector) [out of `input_needed`].
          This can be read **but not updated** by the `NegotiationManager`.
        - `outputs_secured` (np.ndarray):  How many units of the output product
          I already contracted to sell (n_steps vector) [out of `outputs_secured`]

          `__init__` method).
        - `Provides` section describes the attributes (methods, properties, data-members) made available by this

          or properties/data-members that must exist in the agent that uses this component. These requirement are
          usually implemented as abstract methods in the component
        - `Abstract` section describes abstract methods that MUST be implemented by any descendant of this component.
        - `Hooks Into` section describes the methods this component overrides calling `super` () which allows other
          components to hook into the same method (by overriding it). Usually callbacks starting with `on_` are
          hooked into this way.
        - `Overrides` section describes the methods this component overrides without calling `super` effectively
          disallowing any other components after it in the MRO to call this method. Usually methods that do some
          action (i.e. not starting with `on_`) are overridden this way.
