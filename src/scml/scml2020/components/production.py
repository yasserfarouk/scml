class ProductionStrategy:
    """Represents a strategy for controlling production.

    Provides:
        - `schedule_range` : A mapping from contract ID to a tuple of the first and last steps at which some lines
          are occupied to produce the quantity specified by the contract and whether it is a sell contract
        - `can_be_produced` : Given a contract, it returns whether or not it is possible to produce the quantity
          entailed by it (which means that there is enough vacant production line slots before/after the contracts
          delivery time for sell/buy contracts).

    Hooks Into:
        - `on_contract_breached`
        - `on_contract_executed`

        - `Attributes` section describes the attributes that can be used to construct the component (passed to its
          `__init__` method).
        - `Provides` section describes the attributes (methods, properties, data-members) made available by this
          component directly. Note that everything provided by the bases of this components are also available to the
          agent (Check the `Bases` section above for all the bases of this component).
        - `Requires` section describes any requirements from the agent using this component. It defines a set of methods
          or properties/data-members that must exist in the agent that uses this component. These requirement are
          usually implemented as abstract methods in the component
        - `Abstract` section describes abstract methods that MUST be implemented by any descendant of this component.
        - `Hooks Into` section describes the methods this component overrides calling `super` () which allows other
          components to hook into the same method (by overriding it). Usually callbacks starting with `on_` are
          hooked into this way.
        - `Overrides` section describes the methods this component overrides without calling `super` effectively
          disallowing any other components after it in the MRO to call this method. Usually methods that do some
          action (i.e. not starting with `on_`) are overridden this way.
