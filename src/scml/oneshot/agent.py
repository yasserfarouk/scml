Implements the base classes for all agents that can join a `SCML2020OneShotWorld`.


Remarks:
    - You can access all of the negotiators associated with the agent using
      `self.negotiators` which is a dictionary mapping the `negotiator_id` to
      a tuple of two values: The `SAONegotiator` object and a key-value context
      dictionary. In 2021, the context will always be empty.
    - The `negotiator_id` associated with a negotiation with some partner will
      be the same as the agent ID of that partner. This means that all negotiators
      engaged with some partner over all simulation steps will have the same ID
      which is useful if you are keeping information about past negotiations and
      partner behavior.

              and with the partner who sent it receiving the result of `best_outcome`
