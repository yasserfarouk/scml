Changelog
=========

0.6.2 (2023.11.27)
------------------

* upgrading CI to python 3.12
* importing observations
* dropping support for python < 3.10
* Completing first draft of the RL environment

0.6.1 (2023.7.9)
----------------

* Moving scml.scml2020.utils to scml.utils (to avoid a circular import in rl/factory)
* This is an initial effort to have RL work for scml. Currently we are disabling the extra checks on observation and
  world construction because they lead to failures. This needs to be rectified later.
* Added the concept of a WorldFactory to generate worlds with predefined characteristics from the point of view of the learning agent.
* Now environments, action managers, and observation managers all receive WorldFactory objects and automatically check for compatibility.

0.6.0 (2023.7.9)
----------------

* Upgrading to be compatible with NegMAS 0.10.0
* Adding step_with() to oneshot allowing for single counter-offer set stepping of the simulation (to be used to expose the simulation as RL and MARL environments later).
* Adding current_negotiation_details to OneShotAWI to get details of running negotiation
* Adding managed sales, supplies, total_sales, total_supplies, needed_sales, and needed_supplies to the OneShotAWI
* Extending OneShotState returned from awi.state and awi.default_state_encoder(mechanism_states) to expose more information about the simulation

0.5.6 (2023.3.8)
----------------

* Upgrading to be compatible with NegMAS 0.9.8
* Updating notebooks for 2023 release
* Adding 2023 specific classes and utility functions
* Supporting most recent negmas version on Github
* Adding the ability to use raw collusion scores
	In the collusion track, it is now possible to control how much does the
	raw collusion score affect the final score relative to the difference
	between raw collusion score and standard score.
* more reobust renaming when reveal-names is set

0.5.5 (2022.5.18)
-----------------
* bugfix in anac2022_* methods: Score reporting was not accurate because of a change in naming convention in negmas.
* adding agent-processes to SCML2022World.generate
* Adding SCML2022World which is just an alias for SCML2021World
* bugfix #96 Partial List of Agent Scores: Also discussion $94
    * Incorrect agent types and mysterious agents appearing in the scores
      list.
    * Inaccurate placement of agents in the simulation
* disabling tests taking too long on CI
* commenting members of Profile, Contract in oneshot

0.5.4 (2022.5.15)
-----------------
* Disabling adapter testing. Adapting SCML2020 and OneShot agents is too much effort and is not reallly that useful. We will eventually remove support for that.
* Improving control over oneshot world generation. SCML2020OneShotWorld.generat() method now is more consistent in the way it creates agents.
* Adding wide_price_range to control the unit-price range

0.5.3 (2022.5.14)
-----------------
* randomizing starting agents in oneshot
* improving AWI typing in oneshot
* Resetting agents before making negotiations
*   - before_step() was also resetting agents in oneshot. This meant that all
*   negotiators that were created in _make_negotiations() were deleted in
*   reset().
*   - Now we call  reset() before making negotaitions and before_step() after
*   that.
*   - This guarantees that the agent has access to its negotiators in
*   before_step() as in 2020.
* Adding new collusion evaluation
* Goal: Disentangle the quality of the collusion strategy and the standard
* strategy.
* Method: Each agent now has 3 factories in collusion. We run four
* simulations:
* - s0: The agent controls all of the three factories
* - s1-s3: The agent controls one of them
* The final score of the agent is its score in s0 minus the average score
* it got in s1-s3
* Avoid calling counter_all before first_offers
* github actions update
* improved testing of sync behavior
* Confirming that OneShotSync gets all offers every counter_all() call and upper limiting the difference in negotiation speeds based on Jackson's code
