Ideas for developing you agent (OneShot)
----------------------------------------

The one shot game is simpler than the standard game but it is still a
challenging problem. Here are some ideas that you can use for your
agent:

IDEA 1: Learn the acceptance strategy of your partners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You negotiate with the same partners (suppliers, and consumers)
repeatedly. Moreover, each supplier/consumer is driven partially by a
stable set of variables (e.g. exogenous contract’s mean quantity,
production cost, disposal cost, and delivery cost). This means that you
can learn what kinds of agreements will each one of them be able to
accept over time and adjust your negotiation behavior specifically to
each of them.

IDEA 2: Predict future market conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The trading prices are public information this year. This means you
should be able to extrapolate future market conditions and use this to
adapt your behavior. Even though your profits in every step are
independent from the future, your concession strategy may depend on your
expectation about the future of the market.

Final Remarks
-------------

The ideas presented above are, by no means, exclusive or comprehensive.
You can combine them and add new ones or you may like any of them. The
main reason we present these ideas is to *challenge you to come with
better ones*.
